    content: [
      { heading: '1. Inspect Your Roof and Gutters', body: 'Check for missing or damaged tiles, blocked gutters, and early signs of water seepage. Post-monsoon inspection is especially important in India. Clear debris from gutters and check downspouts flow properly.' },
      { heading: '2. Service Your Air Conditioners', body: 'Before summer begins, have all AC units serviced. Clean or replace filters, check refrigerant levels, inspect drainage pipes, and test all settings. A serviced AC uses up to 15% less electricity.' },
      { heading: '3. Check All Electrical Panels and MCBs', body: 'Annual inspection of your electrical panel, MCBs, and wiring can prevent fires and save lives. Look for tripped breakers, scorched marks, or buzzing sounds — call a licensed electrician immediately if you notice any.' },
      { heading: '4. Inspect Plumbing for Leaks', body: 'Even a slow drip wastes thousands of litres of water per year. Inspect all visible pipes, faucets, toilet cisterns, and under-sink connections. Check water pressure and look for rust stains indicating pipe corrosion.' },

      { heading: 'Check for Hidden Leaks Monthly', body: 'Take your water meter reading, don\'t use any water for 2 hours, then re-check. If the reading has changed, you have a hidden leak somewhere. Common locations include under-sink pipes, cisterns, and outdoor taps.' },

      { heading: 'Step 2: Inspect and Clean the Condenser Coils', body: 'The outdoor unit\'s condenser coils collect dirt and debris over months of non-use. Clean them carefully with a soft brush or have a technician clean them professionally before the season starts.' },
      { heading: 'Step 3: Check Refrigerant Levels', body: 'Low refrigerant (gas) is the most common reason ACs don\'t cool effectively. This needs to be checked and refilled by a certified technician. Never attempt to handle refrigerant yourself.' },
      { heading: 'Step 4: Test Drainage and Clean the Drain Pan', body: 'Blocked drain pipes cause water to drip from the indoor unit. Flush the drain pipe with a diluted bleach solution and ensure the drain pan is clean and properly angled.' },

Spotting these is a clear sign of active termite activity.' },
      { heading: 'Warning Sign 2: Hollow-Sounding Wood', body: 'Tap on wooden frames, flooring, and furniture. If it sounds hollow, termites may have eaten the interior wood while leaving the outer surface intact. This is especially common in wooden door frames and false ceilings.' },
