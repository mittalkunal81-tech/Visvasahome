    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle hazardous areas or specialized equipment?",
      answer: "Yes, for specific hazardous zones. Our technicians are trained in industrial safety protocols. Highly specialized equipment (CNC machines, custom automation) is assessed separately during the facility visit.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the emergency response managed?",
      answer: "All plans include emergency support. The Manufacturing plan guarantees a 4-hour on-site response. Large Industrial plans include a dedicated emergency response protocol with 2-hour response SLAs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are statutory compliance reports provided?",
      answer: "Yes. The Manufacturing plan includes monthly compliance logs. The Large Industrial plan includes quarterly reports for factory inspectors, fire safety authorities, and pollution control boards.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you provide an on-site full-time technician?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle routine vs. breakdown maintenance?",
      answer: "Routine preventive maintenance is scheduled as per a fixed calendar agreed upon contract signing. Breakdown maintenance is attended within the SLA response time of your plan with no additional call-out charges.",
